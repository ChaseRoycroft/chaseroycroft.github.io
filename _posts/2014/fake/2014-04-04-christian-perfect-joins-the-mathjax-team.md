We’re very happy to announce that [Christian Perfect](https://github.com/christianp) has joined the MathJax development team.

During his day job, Christian is the lead developer of [Newcastle University](http://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths/numbas/)'s open-source e-assessment system [Numbas](https://github.com/numbas/). Christian has been an active community member for a few years now, [contributing](http://checkmyworking.com/2011/09/a-bookmarklet-which-typesets-tex-on-any-page-using-mathjax/) [many](http://checkmyworking.com/2012/06/instant-mathjax-preview-of-latex-typed-into-html-textareas/) [cool](https://github.com/christianp/knockout-mathjax-bindings) [tools](http://checkmyworking.com/misc/MathJax-play-area/) to the community.

We’re excited Christian is joining MathJax and we look forward to working with him.

The MathJax Team.
