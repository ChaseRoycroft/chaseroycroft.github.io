The [London Mathematical Society](https://lms.ac.uk/) continues to support MathJax as a MathJax Supporter.

The London Mathematical Society (LMS) is the major UK learned society for mathematics with a nationwide and international membership. The LMS offers a rich publishing program, provides a diverse grant program, and organizes scientific meetings and lectures. Beyond that, the LMS  contributes to public debate on matters affecting mathematics and mathematics education.

“LMS offers MathJax full-text HTML as an alternative to PDF on five of its journals and is preparing to implement it on further journals." comments Dr. Ola Tornkvist,

Managing Editor, LMS, "Feedback from readers has been positive, focusing on improved navigation and ease of access when looking something up in a paper. The LMS is pleased to continue to support the MathJax project.“

“Thanks to our dedicated sponsors like the LMS, we are able to develop MathJax continuously,” comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. “We are grateful for the continued support which allows us to keep MathJax the high-quality and universal rendering solution it is today”.

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with the LMS, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
