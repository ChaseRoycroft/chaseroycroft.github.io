Short bio:

Hello! My name is Chase Roycroft. I'm a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and I love STEM!! Time and time again these fields have upended the foundations of our society, almost always for the better. As a naturalist, I think that physical processes, not gods or demons, underlie the natural world. As a transhumanist, I think we have an obligation to extend humanity's capacities to improve ourselves and understand the world. As a species, humanity should strive to drastically reduce military spending, and focus on genetic engineering and stem cell research, theoretical physics, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and space exploration. We should also be working to improve renewable energy and public education.
