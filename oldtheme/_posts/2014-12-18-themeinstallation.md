## How to install Freshman theme?

The theme I'm using for this site is really nice, but I didn't create it. here's how you can install it too. :)

```bash
# please make sure you have already installed git tools and ruby tools(gem)
$ gem install sass
$ gem install jekyll
$ git clone https://github.com/yulijia/freshman21.git
```

Then, change the folder name to you own github page name, forexample

```bash
 $ mv freshman thisisyouname.github.io
```
