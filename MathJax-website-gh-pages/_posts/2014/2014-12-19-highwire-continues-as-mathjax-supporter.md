[The HighWire Open Platform](http://home.highwire.org/) provides innovative technology solutions to influential societies, university presses, and independent publishing organizations, assisting in the digital dissemination and readability of some of the most high-impact journals, books, and other scholarly materials on the net.

"As a pioneer in online journals, HighWire has been a strong supporter of initiatives such as the development of MathJax’s open source platform for display of mathematics," said Xenia Siller, VP, Platform and Content Solutions, HighWire Press. "The HighWire Open Platform is designed to work well with standards such as MathML to ensure accurate dissemination and elegant user experiences across devices and output channels. We’re proud to be part of the solution for readers."

"As a MathJax sponsor, HighWire provides the MathJax team with important feedback for our development," comments Peter Krautzberger, MathJax manager. "Thanks to dedicated sponsors like HighWire we can keep MathJax the high-quality, reliable, and flexible rendering solution it is today."

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with HighWire and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
