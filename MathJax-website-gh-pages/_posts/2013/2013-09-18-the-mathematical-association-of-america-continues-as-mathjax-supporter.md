MathJax is pleased to announce that [The Mathematical Association of America](http://www.maa.org/) (MAA) has renewed its support as a MathJax Supporter.

With a mission to advance the mathematical sciences, the [MAA](http://www.maa.org) is the largest professional society that focuses on mathematics accessible at the collegiate level. The MAA has been an early adopter of communicating mathematics online with electronic resources such as [MathDL](http://mathcomm.org/), [born-digital ebooks](http://www.maa.org/publications/ebooks/calculus-modeling-and-application-2nd-edition) and [journals](http://www.maa.org/publications/periodicals). Its open-source homework system [WeBWorK](http://webwork.maa.org/) is used at over [500 institutions worldwide](http://webwork.maa.org/wiki/WeBWorK_Sites#.UjkYtd_ZXZg).

"The Mathematical Association of America is very pleased to continue its support of the MathJax effort," says MAA Director of Publications Ivars Peterson. "MathJax is an integral part of the MAA's recently refreshed website, greatly expanding our capabilities for communicating mathematics to a wide audience."

The MathJax team looks forward to continuing the collaboration with MAA and welcomes their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
