[IOP Publishing](http://ioppublishing.org/) continues to support the MathJax project as a MathJax Supporter.

As a leading scientific society the [Institute of Physics](http://www.iop.org/) (IOP) promotes physics and brings together physicists for the benefit of all. IOP Publishing provides a range of journals, magazines, websites and services that enable researchers and research organisations to reach the widest possible audience for their research. [IOPscience](http://iopscience.iop.org/), IOP Publishingâ€™s journal and book platform, leverages MathJax to render mathematics and physics clearly and accessibly to its readers on all platforms.

We look forward to continuing the collaboration with IOP, and welcome their ongoing support for the MathJax project.
